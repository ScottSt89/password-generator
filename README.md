# Password Generator

## Description:

I've created a very useful password generator, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that will prompt and ask for a number of characters (between 8-128). The application asks if you would like lower case letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers to generate a random password that may be copied and pasted into any other program or text file after for use by the user.

**Disclaimer: This password generator does not save generated passwords in any database, so the user will have to store generated passwords elsewhere.**
